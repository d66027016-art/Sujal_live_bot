### 🌟 Premium Features

#### 📦 High-Fidelity Dashboard
- **Pixel-Accurate UI**: A classic Minecraft inventory layout with Armor slots, Crafting grid, Off-hand, and Hotbar.
- **🎨 MOTD Color Support**: Real-time console rendering of Minecraft color codes (`§a`, `§c`, etc.) and modern **Hex Color Gradients**.
- **⏲️ Live Promo Countdown**: Visual real-time timer (MM:SS) showing exactly when the next promotional message will be sent.
- **Remote Interaction**: Full control over inventory (Equip, Consume, Drop) directly from your mobile or desktop browser.

#### 🧠 Advanced Automation
- **🚀 Reliable Auto-Responder**: Detects and responds to chat triggers (`help`, `ping`, `bot`) using a deep packet processor that bypasses server chat plugins.
- **Lobby Escape**: Automated NPC navigation and "Use Held Item" manual fallback to ensure you reach the survival world every time.
- **Chat Game Solver**: Automatically detects and answers Math equations and Word Scrambles in milliseconds.
- **Anti-Stuck Logic**: Intelligent movement and jump-triggers to prevent server kicks for inactivity.

#### 🔒 Enterprise Stability
- **Auto-Reconnect**: 24/7 uptime with automated session recovery and error handling.
- **Dashboard Auth**: Password-protected web console (`ADMIN_PASS`) to keep your controls private.
